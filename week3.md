# Task - MusicXML and MEI files:  
Using the created [musescore](musescore_edited_10Bars.mscz) file from last week for this week's activity. It was unfortunately a challenge to create a file and convert the score through the MusicXML converter (see image below) as the website wouldnâ€™t convert the score, no matter what file was used. This result was achieved despite different types of files uploaded it simply wouldn't work.

## Task - To be continued...
The issue has been resolved and [MusicXML]
*  [MEI file](Heatherfullscore.mei)
*  [MusicXML](Heatherfullscore.musicxml)
*  [Previous week edited MusicXML File](plsworkyworky.musicxml)
  * The files were created and issues identified, the reason Verovio would not run is due to the files being saved and uploaded incorrectly.
  * The files should have been uploaded uncompressed - to achieve the following result see images below of the result.
