# Task - MusicXML and MEI files:  
Using the created [musescore](musescore_edited_10Bars.mscz) file from last week for this week's activity. It was unfortunately a challenge to create a file and convert the score through the MusicXML converter (see image below) as the website wouldnâ€™t convert the score, no matter what file was used.
