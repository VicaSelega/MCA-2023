The main aspect not properly transcribed by the OMR engine was the first two bars, where some notes were missing. However, the main issue and struggle was the additional voice that was added on top of the piano notes, ‘the voice’ line and bars did not have any notes on them either, hence the empty line. This is a very different issue from the group work on Tuesday, as on Tuesday we used a more complicated piece of work. Additionally, the piece that the group used on Tuesday was not retrieved from Muscore, which could be why the piece used in the individual labs came out with fewer faults. Update, trial and error,  the issue was solved through the upper settings and changing the instruments, aswell as removing the solo voice.
