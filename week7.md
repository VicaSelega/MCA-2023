## Task Evaluation
I had great difficulties adding genre to MEI header, even after using the guidance provided in the [instructions](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=3851762) for the individual lab in week 5. As such, the genre is included as an additional note instead of a properly integrated subheading, as I was unable to figure out how to do this without receiving an error message.

The MEI guidelines provided helped structure the header. I adhered to them to the best of my ability to ensure clarity and compliance. After stating the title, I added a subheading to clarify the type of rendition to the viewer. Additionally, I chose to include the lyricist and the arranger (producer), as these two roles are the most prominent and relevant to composition in mainstream contemporary music.

The publisher, publication date, and location were included to inform the viewer of the origins of the piece, as well as contextualize the copyright information included.
## Further Evaluation
To expand on what could have been done to make the data formatting better, the order of the data should have been different and followed the formatting suggested by Moodle. The Data presented is displayed in a cluttered manner, in addition, it is difficult to read, despite it having all the needed information it lacks in organization.
