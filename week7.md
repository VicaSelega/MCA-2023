## Task Evaluation Week.7
I had great difficulties adding genre to MEI header, even after using guidance provided in the instructions for the individual lab in week 5. As such, the genre is included as an additional note instead of a properly integrated subheading, as I was unable to figure out how to do this without receiving an error message.

The MEI guidelines provided were helpful in structuring the header. I adhered to them to the best of my ability to ensure clarity and compliance. After stating the title, I added a subheading to clarify the type of rendition to the viewer. Additionally, I chose to include the lyricist and the arranger (producer), as these two roles are the most prominent and relevant to composition in mainstream contemporary music.

The publisher, publication date, and location were included to inform the viewer of the origins of the piece, as well as contextualize the copyright information included.
