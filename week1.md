# Task - Finding a theme:
The dataset in focus revolves around the musical contributions of the pop artist Conan Gray, who is an important pop culture figure in my life, his music is extremely relatable and comforting, and at the point of this project, his music is one of the very few subjects that make the day to day life feel okey. This project revolves specifically around his instrumental renditions of his songs, as it suits the purpose and my skill level more, to analyze it in this form. 

These instrumental versions are obtainable on the MuseScore platform, where a comprehensive collection of piano instrumentals is accessible. The dataset not only includes audio recordings but also encompasses metadata accessible on the website. This metadata provides insightful details such as the genre classification, level of difficulty, duration, and the extent of engagement by indicating the number of individuals who have accessed the site. It is noteworthy that Conan Gray represents a contemporary musical artist, thereby mitigating potential complexities associated with the establishment of historical or regional origins. The modern temporal context of Conan Gray's work serves to streamline the evaluation and interpretation of the dataset, facilitating a more focused analysis of the instrumental versions and associated metadata available on MuseScore.

# Task 2/3 - Types of Data: 
My personal experience with music is very limited, given the lack of formal background in music theory, and the vast lack of technical expertise in coding, I choose to stay positive. Nonetheless, my deep-seated passion for music manifests through an extensive and diverse listening repertoire across various genres. The primary challenge I am currently facing is the lack of coding proficiency and comprehensive musical knowledge. My main current interest is the field of music distribution: Looking into the different strategies used by artists on different streaming platforms, in addition to looking into how data is being utilized for different purposes.
