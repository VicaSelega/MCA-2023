# Task - Standards in Curation
### METADATA SCHEMA - what was included and what should have been included 
* In The Updated [MEI](JS/Heatherfullscore(2).mei) file, certain points such as file description, and licensing date is missing as well as the genre of classification. 
* To reflect on what should have been included for further metadata, see the following list: 
Information about music-specific genres for musical objects, in this case, it is POP, a source of metadata is [YouTube](https://youtu.be/24u3NoPvgMw?feature=shared), it is important to mention the copyright belongs to Universal Music Group & Republic Records	and is protected by copyright.
